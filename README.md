# cohort_analysis
This is my experiment with technique called cohort analysis

Sometimes performance evaluation of certain business processes can be obstructed by the time factor. For example, to measure profitability of marketing channels the time of the first visit (or some other action) should be accounted for. If the time span of the data is short and the majority of acquired clients registered during the latest part of the period in question, then those clients simply did not have the opportunity to return the investments. Dividing clients into groups (cohorts) by the time of the required action makes the analysis more reliable. In this document we will explore the data of a movie ticket service and perform simple cohort analysis of marketing channel profitability.
